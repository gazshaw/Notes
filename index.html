			 <p>The cocooning scene from <em>Alien</em>, cut from the original release, is possibly the most harrowing scene [not] in the film. It was supposed to feature towards the end of the movie, when Ripley is already the last remaining crew member alive, or at least we’re led to assume. This cut scene follows a flame-thrower toting Ripley into the Alien’s hive. Here, she finds crew members Dallas and Brett either metamorphosing into or being consumed by an enclosing egg. Dallas is barely alive enough to plead to Ripley to kill him, which she is reluctant to do but ultimately obliges.</p>

</div>

<p>There are various explanations for why the scene was cut, not least pacing. But had it remained, would it have swayed James Cameron away from introducing a queen and drones concept in the sequel <em>Aliens</em>?</p>

			 <p>The Tour of Britain started today with the first stage route taking in Chorley Road, Swinton, near to where I live. I had every intention of watching from the sidelines, but what with the best weather in ages, the neighbours’ kids round playing in our garden, and getting lost in DIY jobs—bush pruning and insulating the shed —it passed me by. I even missed first half an hour of Arsenal vs. United.</p>

			 <p>I was already peeved at missing the Wigan day out due to the train strike, but Salford also lost quite convincingly. It could have been worse scorewise and little changes from last week re: making the playoffs: need to beat Warrington at home next week, defeat Hull KR away the week after, and do Catalans in the last game. Though the way the results went tonight, Catalans may not have the luxury to field a weakened game against us.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Leigh vs. Huddersfield was abandoned in the second half due to floodlight failure. Only the third game to be abandoned before the 60 minutes threshold in the summer era.</p>

<p>It’s a shame then that Hatch is closing soon after 6 years at short notice (September 30th), the land sold/leased to a company (Stack) who plans a similar operation but without any guarantees to the current tenants or permanent staff of continuation or redeployment. The *MEN *reports that these people have only a month’s notice find new premises or new jobs, though they will receive priority during recruitment, there are no certainties.

			 <p>Cal Newport blogs that <a href="https://calnewport.com/we-dont-need-a-new-twitter/">we don’t need another Twitter</a>. I suppose he would say that not being a fan of attention-sapping devices. While Twitter became too big to be a nice, sane, twee, ‘global conversation platform’—and I generally agree that in the broadest sense Twitter had long been a home for toxic babble—there are use cases for good that may be left unfulfilled if the Twitter we knew ceases to be. For example, academic Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/highereducation/2023/07/27/where-now-for-academics-on-social-media-post-twitter/">Mark Carrigan</a> asks where academics will turn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My broader concern is that universities are still pushing… that every upwardly mobile ambitious academic needs to be highly visible on the dominant platform and be seen engaging on a regular basis. That was always bad advice, and, now, it is becoming counterproductive and, in some cases, dangerous, advice…</p>
<p>Twitter facilitated a social infrastructure for academic life in which a limited few with a big social media footprint were able to leverage it to advantage in their academic career, with greater visibility for their publications, a wide network and lots of opportunities. As that breaks down, our academic communities need to get much better at facilitating other modes of engagement so that we are never again so reliant on a big corporate platform…</p>
<p>I’m increasingly convinced there isn’t going to be one single Twitter alternative because the marketplace of Twitter alternatives is so crowded. For an individual academic, the key is to experiment with a platform to get a sense of whether it works…</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/18/building-an-alternative-to-academic-twitter-relies-on-centring-the-experiences-of-lurkers/">Gina Sipley</a> argues that even if Twitter manages to stabilise and maintain the trust of academics it will still block one the main benefits—leveraging their biggest audience, lurkers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lurking is a lucrative form of social media participation for platforms, if the lurker is logged in and the micrometrics of their reading history can be tracked. Content creators and influencers want their tweets to be seen by the largest possible audience; putting restrictions on lurking benefits the platform, not the creator…</p>
<p>Twitter Blue subscribers have access to a reader mode, which declutters the reading experience by displaying fewer ads. By enhancing the reading experience one can more leisurely lurk. However, the cost of subscribing to Twitter Blue reinforces the privileged position of the lurker. Without a subscription to Twitter Blue, lurking is a less enjoyable experience… but its price has jumped to $8 per month. This is a prohibitive price point for academics, many of whom are underemployed…</p>
<p>Without a Twitter Blue subscription, a current Twitter account holder could only read 600 posts per day; a new Twitter account holder could only read 300. That number has recently been lifted to 1,000 posts for current account holders, but a limit of any kind creates a geography of exclusion to lurking. Attempting to read more than the daily allotted posts, will result in a locked account. Although Musk asserts that the restrictions are temporary, no end date has yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Further, TweetDeck, a tool that made it easy to manage and read the tweets of multiple accounts, is no longer a free service and can only be accessed through what is now called X-premium. Twitter’s API library is also no longer open access… The current monthly cost of being a professional lurker: $1,000–$42,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twitter and Facebook also became the first port of call for finding out what was happening right now on a particular topic. Whether that was globally on a breaking news story or hyper-locally to see why those fireworks were going off at 9.50pm on a Tuesday night in September. Today, whether by design or lack of resource, search on both platforms is borked to such a degree that it’s useless. Hashtags, for following topics, conferences and such still work, but the participants and the audience is fracturing.</p>
<p>In terms of getting the message out there, there is something to be said for large platforms that dominate their market. For example, twenty years ago, if you lived in Greater Manchester and wanted a new job, you would buy Thursday’s <em>Manchester Evening News</em>. It was <em>the</em> outlet for advertising and finding job vacancies. The search engines and web aggregators of today are plenty but aren’t as useful, taking up more time and energy to sifter. Similarly, Twitter was <em>the</em> every person’s PR outlet.</p>
<p>So, where to turn? Facebook is too personal. Instagram and TikTok don’t work in the same way; few can record and cut a hot take in one minute, never mind wanting to watch one. Some have turned to Linkedin, but the live element doesn’t really work there either. There is also an inauthenticity to using LinkedIn where we are projections of our professional image rather than our rounded selves. Whatsapp groups and conversations may be an outlet for the live discussion, say at a conference for example, but it’s hardly open to the web.</p>
<p>Meta’s Threads appears to have legs. Although it’s intrinsically linked to Instagram, people seem to like the way its going for it’s more ephemeral, fun nature. Like the early days of Twitter, perhaps, but unlike the early days of Twitter, it does not have a text search function (yet) and does not have an API allowing for third-party clients (yet) like Tweetbot and Twitterific way back when. There are also the usual Meta issues with data collection, oh and those terms and conditions, which most will let slide if Threads hangs around for the long term. Although beyond grabbing market share from Twitter or even hobbling Musk’s X to the extent that it never bounces back, will Meta keep Threads as an ongoing concern, particularly if they can’t monetise it? Will Threads become so big that it inevitably morphs into the more derided, toxic, pre-Musk Twitter? And if you feel this may happen, is it worth investing time into building a profile on there?</p>
<p>Bluesky and Mastodon are in the peloton for taking the bluebird jersey. Bluesky is dragging its feet a little though maybe playing the long game. Mastodon is arguably best placed to be what Twitter was when it was good. Decentralised and open source, Mastodon offers the promise to be whatever you want it to be. Sadly, the infrastructure for Mastodon around instances—all of which have their own ownerships, hosting bills and posting rules—will be confusing to many, and the user experience for finding people and content from those you don’t follow just isn’t there yet, and may never be because of that infrastructure. If you join a niche instance and post on there as you have been doing on Twitter, you may get short shrift from that instance’s administrator. Perhaps you didn’t refer to the correct source, or what you have posted is self-promotory to the extent that it breaks those rules. Mastodon is not yet built for, and may never be, for the mass.</p>
<p>That said, Mastodon is my current fave. As it utilises the decentralised protocol ActivityPub, it offers a route towards services that cover most of the aspects that made old Twitter good, that aggregate content from wherever it is published—whether from websites, blogs, social networks—that are also platform agnostic, thus negating that need for big corporate platforms and, perhaps, why we possibly don’t need another Twitter in the long term. Though it’s arguably closer to a pipe dream. Anyone for RSS?</p>

			 <p>Keith Houston has published a ‘calculator of the day’ for a week or so now in promotion of his new book, <em><a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/empire-of-the-sum/" title="Em­pire of the Sum: The Rise and Reign of the Pocket Cal­cu­lator">Em­pire of the Sum: The Rise and Reign of the Pocket Cal­cu­lator</a></em>. This particular one is a belter and very much a sign of the times: the 1981 Ca­sio QL-10 Cal­cu­lighter. That’s right, a calculator with a cigarette lighter built-in. Old school cool if totally impractical and archaic by 21st century standards.</p>

<p>Keith <a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2023/08/ql-10/">makes an interesting point</a> about this model and Casio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had this been any other cal­cu­lator com­pany, it would be have been en­tirely pos­sible to de­ride the QL-10 as ’80s ex­cess gone mad. But Ca­sio alone could claim method in its mad­ness, be­cause it had got star­ted not with elec­tronic in­stru­ments, as had Hew­lett-Pack­ard; nor with geo­phys­ical sur­vey­ing equip­ment, like Texas In­stru­ments; nor cam­eras, like Canon; but rather, with the humble <em>yu­biwa</em> ci­gar­ette holder. For Ca­sio, the QL-10 was a home­com­ing.</p>

			 <p>Now and again a social media trend emerges that worries or at least concerns. Not necessarily parents, but the issue compounds for them. Four people, all teenagers, have died this year ‘surfing’ trains on the New York Subway. Riding outside trains, usually on-top of carriages, is nothing new as <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2023/08/subway-surfing-teenagers-social-media-quitting-mta.html"><em>Curbed</em> points out</a>.

The match was televised by Sky Sports with colour commentary from Gary Neville, a notable shareholder and former Chief Executive of Salford City. Some claim a bias, but perhaps not as strong a claim as Lance Todd commentating on Salford rugby league matches for the BBC in the 1930s as manager of the club.</p>

			 <p>Four seasons in one day strikes again! Sure you have to expect this in Manchester, particularly if rain isn’t forecast, and there&rsquo;s the local maxim of just buying a decent waterproof coat and getting on with it. But who wants to walk around in a Berghaus when it’s 20℃? (And aren’t in a Britpop tribute band.) Yes, the weather was lovely before July, but—and you call it a hangover from schooldays— the weather in July and August defines the summer, nay the sunny season for the year.

			 <p>The stunt in <em>Live and Let Die</em> where James Bond clears a crocodile-infested lake by using said crocodiles as stepping stones was done by Ross Kananga. It took this crocodile farm owner three failed attempts before the good 4th take. Remarkable, particularly when you consider Kananga father’s was killed by one of those crocodiles. Surely Kananga’s name was taken for the villain’s Mr Big a.k.a Dr Kananga. (Via <a href="https://twitter.com/ATRightMovies/status/1691902651620012039">All the Right Movies</a>)

But what the episode also covered was an old <a href="https://bmxmuseum.com/bikes/raleigh/38402">Raleigh Vektar</a>, a BMX bike with digital displays, a speedometer and a radio; something I had completely forgotten about from my childhood.

			 <p>W. David Marx <a href="https://culture.ghost.io/why-havent-internet-creators-become-superstars">asks</a>: ‘In the mid-1970s, the Sex Pistols only took two years to move up from squalid London squats to the top of the British pop charts. Why hasn&rsquo;t a decade been enough time for DIY online video creators to turn their view counts into mainstream stardom?’</p>
<p>Marx posits a number of conclusions as to why few if any social media sensations can be called mainstream celebrities. I&rsquo;m not entirely sold on them, but what he says here rings true and remains a conundrum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re now at least 15 years into the dominance of online video within youth culture. In the early 2010s, surveys started to find that teenagers were much more interested in YouTube creators than legacy media stars. At the time, it seemed plausible that youth would carry these preferences into their 20s and elevate their favorite creators. That didn’t happen.</p>

I thought it tried to cram too many characters in early doors. Keeping tabs on all the names was an effort. I also don’t think the <em>A Few Good Men</em> style grillings added much to the film. If anything it dragged it out (to 3 hours, plus the 30 minutes of adverts you have to sit through). While it was a valiant effort, I don’t think I could recommend <em>Oppenheimer</em> to everyone.</p>

			 <p>The hot weather continues. Perhaps not for much longer as we’re a week away from Glastonbury. Manchester Confidential posted a tweet this week with a map of the city centre overlaid with the boundary of Glastonbury site, which almost blankets it. My money would have been on Glastonbury being much bigger, only on a hunch; I&rsquo;ve never been.</p>
<p><a href="https://confidentials.com/manchester/eccentric-manchester-the-football-stadium-with-train-running-through">Another interesting article</a> on Manchester Confidential looked at Manchester City—it’s very much their week—and their previous ground but one: Hyde Road. City (and under their previous moniker of Ardwick AFC) played at the Hyde Road ground from 1887 to 1923. The perimeter was so close to a rail track that as the stadium swelled over time with more enclosures added, the club had no choice but to place one of their stands in a corner behind the track.</p>
<p>Bizarrely then, the railway went through the ground. Not only that, but on occasion, trains got on the way of the action!</p>

<p>‘They used to take the industrial boilers out of the boiler works on the line and I&rsquo;ve stories of boilers getting stuck at half time and the people in the Boys Stand (the one on t&rsquo;other side of the tracks) getting somewhat frustrated.’ — Dr Gary James</p>

<p>It being City’s week, during my walk to Victoria Station, I took a photo of a large Nike advert on the side of Manchester’s Arndale Centre, on the corner where Tim Hortons is (and Jessops before that, and that&rsquo;s as far back as I&rsquo;m going). The advert featured Erling Braut Haaland, pointing out that he has won the treble, as the Premier League’s top scorer and its Player of the Year, and the golden boot (or rather the European Golden Shoe). Not a bad first season in England.</p>

<p>Enough talk of Manchester City, but sticking with sport, The Ashes started today. A glorious first day&rsquo;s play by all accounts at Edgbaston, although I mainly listened to it on Test Match Special between meetings. <em>The Economist</em> published an <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/13/england-may-soon-become-the-worlds-best-cricket-team">infographic</a> showing that if England win the series, they will become the number one ranked test side on ELO ranking for the first time since the late 1970s, and it’ll be England’s highest amount of ELO points since 1960 at least. Way to cry in a crushing defeat. ;-)</p>

			 <p>The hot and dry weather has continued since my daughter’s birthday party last Saturday, bar a downpour of Biblical proportions on Monday that tried to put a damper on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-65878851">Manchester City’s treble-winning parade</a> in the city centre. Though as Pep Guardiola remarked, it wouldn’t be a proper Mancunian celebration without rain.</p>
<p>In such sweltering conditions it’s hard not to think, nay fantasise about drinking a cold beer or cider, and cooling your brow with the glass. Steve Dunkley <a href="https://beernouveau.co.uk/je-ne-sais-terroir/">published a brilliant article</a> this week on the concept of terroir in beer. While his label Beer Nouveau maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/BeerNouveau/status/1577602716343455745">on hiatus</a>, Steve continues to write pieces for the website. Terroir is, as Steve puts it, described as the ‘the soul of the land’ and is generally a term used in winemaking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything grown on that land [is] influenced by the land, and that influence [comes] through in the final glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, Steve went to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterCiderClub">Manchester Cider Club</a> tasting session where the <a href="https://littlepomona.com/">Little Pomona</a> cidery in Herefordshire showcased seven ciders, all made from Dabinett apples, with each cider made using apples from a different orchard. While each cider had the same ingredients, each cider had subtle differences in flavour. The apples having taken on the characteristics of the land where the trees were grown. The ‘soul of the orchards’.</p>
<p>The ingredients for wine and cider are similar being there are few and the provenance of the main ingredient responsible for taste can be guaranteed. Less can be said for beer, apart from say hops. Steve found as much during his in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MCRHopProject">Manchester Hop Project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We [were] able to identify a distinct flavour to our regions, all the hops grown in Manchester for instance impart a slight hazelnut flavour to the beer regardless of the hop variety. That is the terroir of Manchester, a bit nutty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article also includes a few more French sayings, one of which I was previously unaware: <em>l’esprit d’escalier</em> – a situation of thinking of the perfect reply to someone as we’re leaving and it’s too late to use that witty comeback.’ Which immediately made me think of the ‘jerk store’ episode of Seinfeld.</p>

<p>Steve Dunkley is also keeping a record of <a href="https://beernouveau.co.uk/2023-brewery-closures/">brewery closures in 2023</a> as he did for <a href="https://beernouveau.co.uk/2022-closures/">2022</a>. It&rsquo;s grim but not unexpected.</p>
