Essentially, this is a wegbier—a beer you consume while walking around or getting from one place to another. Several brands market their beers specifically as wegbiers for this purpose.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Back home, people look askance if you‘re carrying an open bottle of beer in the street… In Berlin, on Saturday night, they look askance if you’re not.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it’s not just for those off work:</p>\n<p>‘One weekday afternoon we watched a smartly-dressed thirty-something couple escorting their small children along the street. Both parents were carrying open bottles of lager as casually as someone in Britain might carry a to-go cappuccino.’</p>\n<p>Remarkable, and the culture is not limited to Berliners either, though perhaps not as accepted or widespread as Berlin.

Essentially, this is a wegbier—a beer you consume while walking around or getting from one place to another. Several brands market their beers specifically as wegbiers for this purpose.  \n\n>‘Back home, people look askance if you‘re carrying an open bottle of beer in the street… In Berlin, on Saturday night, they look askance if you’re not.’\n\nAnd it’s not just for those off work:\n\n‘One weekday afternoon we watched a smartly-dressed thirty-something couple escorting their small children along the street. Both parents were carrying open bottles of lager as casually as someone in Britain might carry a to-go cappuccino.’ \n\nRemarkable, and the culture is not limited to Berliners either, though perhaps not as accepted or widespread as Berlin.

Put too much Peppermint Oil, or even worse, Olbas Oil in there, and I honestly don’t think there'd be much difference than shoving a lit match up your nose. Think Mia Wallace at the moment she snorts the wrong powder.\r\n\r\nMy local pharmacist recommended a product called Sterimar Congestion Relief, which I didn’t question and purchased on the spot. The can is proud to say that it’s ‘FREE FROM steroids [and\\] drugs’, which didn’t leave me with much hope, but nevertheless safe for hypertensionists (?). Essentially, it’s purified seawater that you squirt up the nasal passages. Slightly more effective than blowing your nose dry, but the effect lasts for a few minutes before the blockage returns. Not great then. Prevention, therefore, is the best form of defence here. Now where did I put the leftover PPE?\n",

				"title": "We (possibly) don’t need another Twitter",
				"content_html": "<p>Cal Newport blogs that <a href=\"https://calnewport.com/we-dont-need-a-new-twitter/\">we don’t need another Twitter</a>. I suppose he would say that not being a fan of attention-sapping devices. While Twitter became too big to be a nice, sane, twee, ‘global conversation platform’—and I generally agree that in the broadest sense Twitter had long been a home for toxic babble—there are use cases for good that may be left unfulfilled if the Twitter we knew ceases to be. For example, academic Twitter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/highereducation/2023/07/27/where-now-for-academics-on-social-media-post-twitter/\">Mark Carrigan</a> asks where academics will turn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My broader concern is that universities are still pushing… that every upwardly mobile ambitious academic needs to be highly visible on the dominant platform and be seen engaging on a regular basis. That was always bad advice, and, now, it is becoming counterproductive and, in some cases, dangerous, advice…</p>\n<p>Twitter facilitated a social infrastructure for academic life in which a limited few with a big social media footprint were able to leverage it to advantage in their academic career, with greater visibility for their publications, a wide network and lots of opportunities. As that breaks down, our academic communities need to get much better at facilitating other modes of engagement so that we are never again so reliant on a big corporate platform…</p>\n<p>I’m increasingly convinced there isn’t going to be one single Twitter alternative because the marketplace of Twitter alternatives is so crowded. For an individual academic, the key is to experiment with a platform to get a sense of whether it works…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/18/building-an-alternative-to-academic-twitter-relies-on-centring-the-experiences-of-lurkers/\">Gina Sipley</a> argues that even if Twitter manages to stabilise and maintain the trust of academics it will still block one the main benefits—leveraging their biggest audience, lurkers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lurking is a lucrative form of social media participation for platforms, if the lurker is logged in and the micrometrics of their reading history can be tracked. Content creators and influencers want their tweets to be seen by the largest possible audience; putting restrictions on lurking benefits the platform, not the creator…</p>\n<p>Twitter Blue subscribers have access to a reader mode, which declutters the reading experience by displaying fewer ads. By enhancing the reading experience one can more leisurely lurk. However, the cost of subscribing to Twitter Blue reinforces the privileged position of the lurker. Without a subscription to Twitter Blue, lurking is a less enjoyable experience… but its price has jumped to $8 per month. This is a prohibitive price point for academics, many of whom are underemployed…</p>\n<p>Without a Twitter Blue subscription, a current Twitter account holder could only read 600 posts per day; a new Twitter account holder could only read 300. That number has recently been lifted to 1,000 posts for current account holders, but a limit of any kind creates a geography of exclusion to lurking. Attempting to read more than the daily allotted posts, will result in a locked account. Although Musk asserts that the restrictions are temporary, no end date has yet to be announced.</p>\n<p>Further, TweetDeck, a tool that made it easy to manage and read the tweets of multiple accounts, is no longer a free service and can only be accessed through what is now called X-premium. Twitter’s API library is also no longer open access… The current monthly cost of being a professional lurker: $1,000–$42,000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Twitter and Facebook also became the first port of call for finding out what was happening right now on a particular topic. Whether that was globally on a breaking news story or hyper-locally to see why those fireworks were going off at 9.50pm on a Tuesday night in September. Today, whether by design or lack of resource, search on both platforms is borked to such a degree that it’s close to useless. Hashtags for following topics, conferences and such still work but the participants and the audience is fracturing.</p>\n<p>In terms of getting the message out there, there is something to be said for large platforms that dominate their market. For example, twenty years ago, if you lived in Greater Manchester and wanted a new job, you would buy Thursday’s <em>Manchester Evening News</em>. It was <em>the</em> outlet for advertising and finding job vacancies. The search engines and web aggregators of today are plenty but aren’t as useful, taking up more time and energy to sifter. Similarly, Twitter was <em>the</em> every person’s PR outlet.</p>\n<p>So, where to turn? Facebook is too personal. Instagram and TikTok don’t work in the same way; few can record and cut a hot take in one minute, never mind wanting to watch one. Some have turned to Linkedin, but the live element doesn’t really work there either. There is also an inauthenticity to using LinkedIn where we are projections of our crafted, professional image rather than our real selves. Whatsapp groups and conversations may be an outlet for the live discussion, say at a conference for example, but it’s hardly open.</p>\n<p>Meta’s Threads appears to have legs. Although it’s intrinsically linked to Instagram, people seem to like the way it&rsquo;s going for its more ephemeral, fun nature. Like the early days of Twitter, perhaps. But unlike the early days of Twitter, it does not have a text search function (yet) and does not have an API allowing for third-party clients (yet) like Tweetbot and Twitterific way back when. There are also the usual Meta issues with data collection, oh and those terms and conditions, which most will let slide if Threads hangs around for the long term. Although beyond grabbing market share from Twitter or even hobbling Musk’s X to the extent that it never bounces back, will Meta keep Threads as an ongoing concern, particularly if they can’t monetise it? Will Threads become so big that it inevitably morphs into a more derided, toxic, pre-Musk Twitter? And if you feel this may happen, is it worth investing time into building a profile on there?</p>\n<p>Bluesky and Mastodon are in the peloton for taking the bluebird’s jersey. Bluesky is dragging its feet a little though may be playing the long game. Mastodon is arguably best placed to be what Twitter was when it was good. Decentralised and open source, Mastodon offers the promise to be whatever you want it to be. Sadly, the infrastructure for Mastodon around instances—all of which have their own ownerships, hosting bills and posting rules—will be confusing to many, and the user experience for finding people and content from those you don’t follow just isn’t there yet, and may never be because of that infrastructure. If you join a niche instance and post on there as you have been doing on Twitter, you may get short shrift from that instance’s administrator.

				"content_text": "Cal Newport blogs that [we don’t need another Twitter](https://calnewport.com/we-dont-need-a-new-twitter/). I suppose he would say that not being a fan of attention-sapping devices. While Twitter became too big to be a nice, sane, twee, ‘global conversation platform’—and I generally agree that in the broadest sense Twitter had long been a home for toxic babble—there are use cases for good that may be left unfulfilled if the Twitter we knew ceases to be. For example, academic Twitter.\n\n[Mark Carrigan](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/highereducation/2023/07/27/where-now-for-academics-on-social-media-post-twitter/) asks where academics will turn:\n\n>My broader concern is that universities are still pushing… that every upwardly mobile ambitious academic needs to be highly visible on the dominant platform and be seen engaging on a regular basis. That was always bad advice, and, now, it is becoming counterproductive and, in some cases, dangerous, advice…\n>\n>Twitter facilitated a social infrastructure for academic life in which a limited few with a big social media footprint were able to leverage it to advantage in their academic career, with greater visibility for their publications, a wide network and lots of opportunities. As that breaks down, our academic communities need to get much better at facilitating other modes of engagement so that we are never again so reliant on a big corporate platform…\n>\n>I’m increasingly convinced there isn’t going to be one single Twitter alternative because the marketplace of Twitter alternatives is so crowded. For an individual academic, the key is to experiment with a platform to get a sense of whether it works…\n\n[Gina Sipley](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/18/building-an-alternative-to-academic-twitter-relies-on-centring-the-experiences-of-lurkers/) argues that even if Twitter manages to stabilise and maintain the trust of academics it will still block one the main benefits—leveraging their biggest audience, lurkers:\n\n>Lurking is a lucrative form of social media participation for platforms, if the lurker is logged in and the micrometrics of their reading history can be tracked. Content creators and influencers want their tweets to be seen by the largest possible audience; putting restrictions on lurking benefits the platform, not the creator…\n> \n>Twitter Blue subscribers have access to a reader mode, which declutters the reading experience by displaying fewer ads. By enhancing the reading experience one can more leisurely lurk. However, the cost of subscribing to Twitter Blue reinforces the privileged position of the lurker. Without a subscription to Twitter Blue, lurking is a less enjoyable experience… but its price has jumped to $8 per month. This is a prohibitive price point for academics, many of whom are underemployed…\n>\n>Without a Twitter Blue subscription, a current Twitter account holder could only read 600 posts per day; a new Twitter account holder could only read 300. That number has recently been lifted to 1,000 posts for current account holders, but a limit of any kind creates a geography of exclusion to lurking. Attempting to read more than the daily allotted posts, will result in a locked account. Although Musk asserts that the restrictions are temporary, no end date has yet to be announced.\n>\n>Further, TweetDeck, a tool that made it easy to manage and read the tweets of multiple accounts, is no longer a free service and can only be accessed through what is now called X-premium. Twitter’s API library is also no longer open access… The current monthly cost of being a professional lurker: $1,000–$42,000.\n\nTwitter and Facebook also became the first port of call for finding out what was happening right now on a particular topic. Whether that was globally on a breaking news story or hyper-locally to see why those fireworks were going off at 9.50pm on a Tuesday night in September. Today, whether by design or lack of resource, search on both platforms is borked to such a degree that it’s close to useless. Hashtags for following topics, conferences and such still work but the participants and the audience is fracturing.\n\nIn terms of getting the message out there, there is something to be said for large platforms that dominate their market. For example, twenty years ago, if you lived in Greater Manchester and wanted a new job, you would buy Thursday’s *Manchester Evening News*. It was *the* outlet for advertising and finding job vacancies. The search engines and web aggregators of today are plenty but aren’t as useful, taking up more time and energy to sifter. Similarly, Twitter was *the* every person’s PR outlet.\n\nSo, where to turn? Facebook is too personal. Instagram and TikTok don’t work in the same way; few can record and cut a hot take in one minute, never mind wanting to watch one. Some have turned to Linkedin, but the live element doesn’t really work there either. There is also an inauthenticity to using LinkedIn where we are projections of our crafted, professional image rather than our real selves. Whatsapp groups and conversations may be an outlet for the live discussion, say at a conference for example, but it’s hardly open.\n\nMeta’s Threads appears to have legs. Although it’s intrinsically linked to Instagram, people seem to like the way it's going for its more ephemeral, fun nature. Like the early days of Twitter, perhaps. But unlike the early days of Twitter, it does not have a text search function (yet) and does not have an API allowing for third-party clients (yet) like Tweetbot and Twitterific way back when. There are also the usual Meta issues with data collection, oh and those terms and conditions, which most will let slide if Threads hangs around for the long term. Although beyond grabbing market share from Twitter or even hobbling Musk’s X to the extent that it never bounces back, will Meta keep Threads as an ongoing concern, particularly if they can’t monetise it? Will Threads become so big that it inevitably morphs into a more derided, toxic, pre-Musk Twitter? And if you feel this may happen, is it worth investing time into building a profile on there?\n\nBluesky and Mastodon are in the peloton for taking the bluebird’s jersey. Bluesky is dragging its feet a little though may be playing the long game. Mastodon is arguably best placed to be what Twitter was when it was good. Decentralised and open source, Mastodon offers the promise to be whatever you want it to be. Sadly, the infrastructure for Mastodon around instances—all of which have their own ownerships, hosting bills and posting rules—will be confusing to many, and the user experience for finding people and content from those you don’t follow just isn’t there yet, and may never be because of that infrastructure. If you join a niche instance and post on there as you have been doing on Twitter, you may get short shrift from that instance’s administrator. Perhaps you didn’t refer to the correct source, or what you have posted is too much like self-promotion to the extent that it breaks those rules. Mastodon is not yet built for, and may never be for the mass. \n\nThat said, Mastodon is my current fave. As it utilises the decentralised protocol ActivityPub, it offers a route towards services that cover most of the aspects that made old Twitter good; that aggregate content from wherever it is published—whether from websites, blogs, or social networks—that are also platform agnostic, thus negating that need for big corporate platforms.

The advert featured Erling Braut Haaland, pointing out that he has won the treble, as the Premier League’s top scorer and its Player of the Year, and the golden boot (or rather the European Golden Shoe). Not a bad first season in England.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/117530/2023/arndale-haaland.jpg)\n\nEnough talk of Manchester City, but sticking with sport, The Ashes started today. A glorious first day's play by all accounts at Edgbaston, although I mainly listened to it on Test Match Special between meetings. _The Economist_ published an [infographic](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/13/england-may-soon-become-the-worlds-best-cricket-team) showing that if England win the series, they will become the number one ranked test side on ELO ranking for the first time since the late 1970s, and it’ll be England’s highest amount of ELO points since 1960 at least. Way to cry in a crushing defeat. ;-)\n\n![Copyright © The Economist](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/117530/2023/england-cricket-elo-over-time.png)\n\n_Copyright © The Economist_\n\n\n",
