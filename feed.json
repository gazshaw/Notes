By enhancing the reading experience one can more leisurely lurk. However, the cost of subscribing to Twitter Blue reinforces the privileged position of the lurker. Without a subscription to Twitter Blue, lurking is a less enjoyable experience… but its price has jumped to $8 per month. This is a prohibitive price point for academics, many of whom are underemployed…</p>\n<p>Without a Twitter Blue subscription, a current Twitter account holder could only read 600 posts per day; a new Twitter account holder could only read 300. That number has recently been lifted to 1,000 posts for current account holders, but a limit of any kind creates a geography of exclusion to lurking. Attempting to read more than the daily allotted posts, will result in a locked account.

Whether that was globally on a breaking news story or hyper-locally to see why those fireworks were going off at 9.50pm on a Tuesday night in September. Today, whether by design or lack of resource, search on both platforms is borked to such a degree that it’s useless. Hashtags, for following topics, conferences and such still work, but the participants and the audience is fracturing.</p>\n<p>In terms of getting the message out there, there is something to be said for large platforms that dominate their market. For example, twenty years ago, if you lived in Greater Manchester and wanted a new job, you would buy Thursday’s <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.

Similarly, Twitter was <em>the</em> every person’s PR outlet.</p>\n<p>So, where to turn? Facebook is too personal. Instagram and TikTok don’t work in the same way; few can record and cut a hot take in one minute, never mind wanting to watch one. Some have turned to Linkedin, but the live element doesn’t really work there either. There is also an inauthenticity to using LinkedIn where we are projections of our professional image rather than our rounded selves.

Although it’s intrinsically linked to Instagram, people seem to like the way its going for it’s more ephemeral, fun nature. Like the early days of Twitter, perhaps, but unlike the early days of Twitter, it does not have a text search function (yet) and does not have an API allowing for third-party clients (yet) like Tweetbot and Twitterific way back when. There are also the usual Meta issues with data collection, oh and those terms and conditions, which most will let slide if Threads hangs around for the long term. Although beyond grabbing market share from Twitter or even hobbling Musk’s X to the extent that it never bounces back, will Meta keep Threads as an ongoing concern, particularly if they can’t monetise it? Will Threads become so big that it inevitably morphs into the more derided, toxic, pre-Musk Twitter?

Bluesky is dragging its feet a little though maybe playing the long game. Mastodon is arguably best placed to be what Twitter was when it was good. Decentralised and open source, Mastodon offers the promise to be whatever you want it to be. Sadly, the infrastructure for Mastodon around instances—all of which have their own ownerships, hosting bills and posting rules—will be confusing to many, and the user experience for finding people and content from those you don’t follow just isn’t there yet, and may never be because of that infrastructure. If you join a niche instance and post on there as you have been doing on Twitter, you may get short shrift from that instance’s administrator.
