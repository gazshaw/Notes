				"content_text": "We decided to cram the early part of the week with day trips before Joe’s Achilles operation on Thursday. Merseyside was the destination starting with [Imagine That!](https://imaginethat.org.uk \"Imagine That!\"), a kind of mix between the best bits of [The Little Lancashire Village](https://www.thelittlelancashirevillage.co.uk \"The Little Lancashire Village\") and [Eureka!](https://www.eureka.org.uk \"Eureka!\"). Four zones with 30–40ish minutes in each zone. Anywhere that serves up free samples of ice cream cooled with dry ice is well worth a visit.\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/imagine-that-1.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/imagine-that-2.jpg)\n\nThen, having previously mentioned my work visit to New Brighton, we took another visit, but with much better weather this time around. A small beach, another ice cream, a walk down the promenade and staying for our tea. We enjoyed it. \n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-lighthouse.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-pigeon.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-benches.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-arcade.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-huts.jpg)\n\nI peeled away for 20 minutes or so to take some photos of the street art which adorns several dwellings around the high street.\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-street-art-1.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-street-art-2.jpg)\n\n![](https://notes.gazshaw.co.uk/uploads/2023/new-brighton-street-art-3.jpg)\n\n\n",
